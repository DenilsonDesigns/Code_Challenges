--- NOTES:
    1hr technical interview over zoom. 
    language agnostic, but use your fav lang, and have IDE setup to run (vscode/nodejs).
    might even have a (html/js/css) project setup.
    interview will show an example of something, or give you some kind of setup, then hand over to you.
    interview has infinite scaling possibility.
    can use docs, but describe what youre searching, try to know APIs already.
